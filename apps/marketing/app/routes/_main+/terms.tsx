          <h3>4. Fees</h3>
          <p>
            The subscription fees payable for paid versions of FamDigest are
            listed on our website. Fees are considered incurred on the first day
            of each subscription period.
          </p>
          <p>
            Your subscription will automatically renew at the end of the
            applicable subscription period, unless you cancel your subscription
            before the end of the then-current subscription period. The
            cancellation will take effect the day after the last day of the
            current subscription period.
          </p>
          <p>
            We are entitled to unilaterally increase the fees by providing you
            with 30 days written notice of such increase. Price changes will
            take effect at the start of the next subscription period following
            the date of the price change. Subject to applicable law, you accept
            the new price by continuing to use FamDigest after the price change
            takes effect.
          </p>
          <p>
            Payment is accepted by major credit card using a secure third-party
            payment-processing service. You agree that we may charge the fee,
            applicable taxes and any transaction charges payable by us to your
            credit card.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you wish to dispute any charges, you must give us written notice
            at hello@famdigest.com within 10 days of the charge being applied to
            your credit card, failing which the charges will be deemed to be
            accurate.
          </p>
          <p>
            You are responsible for paying to us any costs incurred by us in
